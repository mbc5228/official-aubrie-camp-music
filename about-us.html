                    ABOUT US
                <br>The beginning of Aubrie's singing career starts at a very young age. She has been making melodies since she
                <br> was an infant. Ever since she was young she always had the desire to pursue music as a career. Despite 
                <br>the fact that this is a stereotypical dream for many young children,
                <br>the dream followed Aubrie into her teen years, and soon into adulthood. In an attempt to further 
                <br>her relationship with music, Aubrie made the decision to audition for season 21 of ABC's
                <br> American Idol. She made it as far as Hollywood round, but then got cut during the duet round. Although neither her 
                <br>audition or any of her performances aired, it was an opportunity for her to grow as a musician. 
                <br>Since her time with American Idol, she has created social media accounts specifially for her music,
                <br>began booking gigs, and launched a website!
